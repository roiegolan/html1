<h2 style="text-align:center;color:000080"><u>About Ferrari</u></h2>
<p style="font-size:120%;text-align:left;color:#001a4d;background-color:#008c45">Ferrari (/fəˈrɑːri/; Italian: [ferˈraːri]) is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in Maranello, Italy. Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939 out of Alfa Romeo's race division as Auto Avio Costruzioni, the company built its first car in 1940. However, the company's inception as an auto manufacturer is usually recognized in 1947, when the first Ferrari-badged car was completed.

Fiat S.p.A. acquired 50% of Ferrari in 1969 and expanded its stake to 90% in 1988. In October 2014 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCA) announced its intentions to separate Ferrari S.p.A. from FCA; as of the announcement FCA owned 90% of Ferrari. The separation began in October 2015 with a restructuring that established Ferrari N.V. (a company incorporated in the Netherlands) as the new holding company of the Ferrari group and the subsequent sale by FCA of 10% of the shares in an IPO and concurrent listing of common shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Through the remaining steps of the separation, FCA's interest in Ferrari's business was distributed to shareholders of FCA, with 10% continuing to be owned by Piero Ferrari.[8] The spin-off was completed on 3 January 2016.[7]

Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially in Formula One, where it is the oldest and most successful racing team, holding the most constructors championships and having produced the highest number of drivers' championship wins. Ferrari road cars are generally seen as a symbol of speed, luxury and wealth. Ferrari cars are built at the 165,000 square-meter (16.5-hectare) Maranello factory. In 2014 Ferrari was rated the world's most powerful brand by Brand Finance. In June 2018, the 1963 250 GTO became the most expensive car in history, setting an all-time record selling price of $70 million.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;color:000080"><u>About Lamborghini</u></h2>
<p style="font-size:120%;text-align:left;color:#001a4d;background-color:#f4f5f0">Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. (Italian pronunciation: [lamborˈɡiːni]) is an Italian brand and manufacturer of luxury sports cars and SUVs based in Sant'Agata Bolognese. The company is owned by the Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary Audi.

Ferruccio Lamborghini, an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with established marques, including Ferrari. The company was noted for using a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division.

New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an increased productivity for the brand. In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 percent.

Lamborghini currently produces the V12-powered Aventador and the V10-powered Huracán, along with the Urus SUV powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine. In addition, the company produces V12 engines for offshore powerboat racing. Lamborghini Trattori, founded in 1948 by Ferruccio Lamborghini, is headquartered in Pieve di Cento, Italy and continues to produce tractors.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;color:000080"><u>So Which Is Better?</u></h2>
<p style="font-size:120%;text-align:left;color:#001a4d;background-color:#cd212a">Ferrari and Lamborghini are both household names. Even people who do not consider themselves to be “car people” are familiar with these manufacturers, and the names conjure up images of gorgeous, high-performing vehicles. 
The appeal of these cars is completely understandable: after all, Ferrari and Lamborghini make stunning and powerful cars. 
If you have the funds, you may be inclined to put them towards one of these vehicles. However, even though both manufacturers produce top-quality cars, there are differences between the two. Before making a purchase, you will want to consider these differences and decide which type of vehicle suits you and your preferences best.Ferrari and Lamborghini are most strongly associated with sports cars. Both do offer sports cars, however, Ferrari also offers Grand Tourer (GT) models. GT cars are still high-performance cars, with high horsepower and high speeds. 
However, a GT model will tend to offer more comfort, and is often slightly larger. This is because GT cars were originally conceived and thus designed for long distance road travel. Ferrari even produced some of the first GT vehicles. Lamborghini, however, does not offer any GT models, and as of 2019 only offers 3 sports car models. However, as of 2019 Lamborghini has begun to offer an SUV: the Lamborghini Urus.
Horsepower and speed are also strongly associated with these manufacturers. As of 2019, the fastest street-legal Ferrari is the 488 Pista, with a maximum speed just over 210 mph and the ability to accelerate to 60 mph in under 3 seconds. However, the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ just edges past that with a maximum speed at 217 mph, with a similar acceleration time. 
Lamborghini also tends to produce higher horsepower vehicles.</p>
